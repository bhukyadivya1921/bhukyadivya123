<h1 align="left">Hey ðŸ‘‹ What's up?</h1>

###

<p align="left">My name is  Divya, currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering at Gokaraju Rangaraju Institute of Engineering and Technology, Hyderabad, with a GPA of 8.37. Prior to this, I completed my intermediate education at TTWREI College of Excellence, Warangal, securing an impressive 89.5%. My academic foundation was laid at Montessori High School in Bhupalpally, where I achieved a CGPA of 8.8.<br><br>During my intermediate studies, I was honored to be elected as a College People Leader. In this role, I actively addressed student concerns and college issues, liaising directly with the principal to devise and implement necessary actions. This responsibility not only honed my leadership and problem-solving skills but also instilled in me the importance of effective communication and teamwork.<br><br>In addition to my academic achievements and leadership roles, I have led projects such as 'Kidney Stone Detection' using Canny edge detection and CNN. I have also contributed to the 'G-Platform for Enhanced Visual Communication' by implementing the YOLOv5 algorithm. Professionally, I have gained experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Java, Python, and web development. To further augment my skills, I have earned certifications in cybersecurity, Python programming, and data science engineering.<br><br>Outside of my academic and professional endeavors, I have actively participated in debates, elocution, and parliament-related competitions. These experiences have not only enhanced my public speaking and critical thinking abilities but also fueled my passion for continuous learning and self-improvement.<br><br>With a blend of strong technical skills, soft skills like problem-solving and effective communication, and a proven track record of leadership and project management, I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and make meaningful advancements in the field of technology.</p>
